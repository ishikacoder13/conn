1. Install MySQL Connector for Python
MySQL Connector is the official MySQL driver for Python. You can install it using pip inside VS Code's terminal.

Open the VS Code terminal by pressing Ctrl + ~.

Run the following command to install the MySQL Connector:

bash
Copy code
pip install mysql-connector-python
2. Create a Python Script to Connect to MySQL
After installing the MySQL connector, you can create a Python script that connects to your MySQL database.

Create a new Python file, e.g., mysql_connection.py.

Add the following code to connect to the MySQL database:

python
Copy code
import mysql.connector

# Replace the following details with your MySQL database information
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",      # Your MySQL host (e.g., localhost or IP address)
    user="your_username",  # Your MySQL username
    password="your_password",  # Your MySQL password
    database="your_database"  # Your MySQL database name
)

if connection.is_connected():
    print("Connected to MySQL database")

    # Create a cursor to interact with the database
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SHOW TABLES")

    for table in cursor.fetchall():
        print(table)

    # Close the connection
    connection.close()
else:
    print("Connection failed")
3. Run the Script in VS Code
Save the file.

Run the Python script by pressing F5 or by typing the following in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
python mysql_connection.py
4. Output
If the connection is successful, you should see output similar to the following:

java
Copy code
Connected to MySQL database
('your_table_name',)
...
Key Points:
Make sure your MySQL server is running.
Replace the host, user, password, and database with your actual MySQL credentials.
If you're using a remote database, replace localhost with the IP or domain of the server.
